# Implement Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The Conference Research application currently lacks automated testing infrastructure, making it risky to refactor code, add new features, or ensure reliability of recent security fixes. Without proper test coverage, we cannot confidently validate that:

- File upload validation works correctly across different scenarios
- API retry mechanisms function as expected under various failure conditions
- WebDriver cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Biographical profile generation produces consistent results
- Error handling behaves correctly for edge cases

This creates technical debt that increases maintenance burden and reduces development velocity.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

### Core Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up **pytest** framework with proper configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Create **test fixtures** for common test data (CSV files, mock API responses)
- [ ] Implement **test database/file cleanup** to ensure test isolation
- [ ] Add **pytest plugins** for coverage, mock, and async testing

### Unit Tests (Target: 70% coverage minimum)
- [ ] **File Validation Tests** (`tests/test_file_validation.py`)
  - Test `validate_file_upload()` with various file types, sizes, and malicious content
  - Validate MIME type checking and filename sanitization
  - Test edge cases: empty files, corrupted files, oversized files
- [ ] **API Retry Mechanism Tests** (`tests/test_retry_logic.py`)
  - Test `@retry_api_call` decorator with different failure scenarios
  - Validate exponential backoff timing and maximum retry limits
  - Test specific exception handling (OpenAI, requests, connection errors)
- [ ] **Web Scraping Tests** (`tests/test_web_scraping.py`)
  - Test `scrape_text_from_url()` with mock HTTP responses
  - Validate timeout handling and User-Agent configuration
  - Test HTML parsing and text extraction accuracy
- [ ] **Bio Generation Tests** (`tests/test_bio_generation.py`)
  - Test `generate_bio_with_chatgpt()` with mock OpenAI responses
  - Validate email extraction from generated bios
  - Test prompt construction and token management

### Integration Tests
- [ ] **API Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/test_api_endpoints.py`)
  - Test OpenAI API integration with real/mock endpoints
  - Test Google Serper API search functionality
  - Test DuckDuckGo search fallback mechanisms
- [ ] **WebDriver Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/test_webdriver.py`)
  - Test WebDriver context manager lifecycle
  - Validate proper cleanup and memory management
  - Test reading list scraping functionality

### Mock Testing
- [ ] **Create Mock Services** (`tests/mocks/`)
  - Mock OpenAI API responses for consistent testing
  - Mock Google Serper API search results
  - Mock WebDriver behavior for UI testing
- [ ] **Test Data Fixtures** (`tests/fixtures/`)
  - Sample CSV/XLSX files for upload testing
  - Example bio generation responses
  - Test configuration files

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
  - Run tests on Python 3.9+ across multiple OS (Ubuntu, Windows)
  - Generate and upload coverage reports
  - Fail builds on coverage below 70%
  - Cache pip dependencies for faster builds
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hooks** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
  - Run tests before commits
  - Check code formatting and linting
  - Validate import sorting and security checks

### Testing Documentation
- [ ] **Testing Guide** (`docs/TESTING.md`)
  - How to run tests locally
  - Writing new tests guidelines
  - Mock testing best practices
  - Debugging test failures

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

### Testing Strategy:
1. **Start with critical path testing** - file validation and API retry logic
2. **Use dependency injection** where possible to make code more testable
3. **Mock external services** to ensure tests are fast and reliable
4. **Focus on edge cases** that caused recent bugs (bare exceptions, memory leaks)

### Mock Testing Approach:
- Use `responses` library for HTTP API mocking
- Use `pytest-mock` for function and class mocking
- Create realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios
- Test both success and failure paths for all external integrations

### Coverage Goals:
- **Minimum 70% overall coverage** before issue can be closed
- **90%+ coverage for critical security functions** (file validation, API retry)
- **Exception handling paths must be tested** to prevent regression of recent fixes

## 📊 Success Metrics

- [ ] All tests pass consistently across different environments
- [ ] Test suite runs in under 5 minutes locally
- [ ] Code coverage reports show 70%+ coverage
- [ ] Zero test flakiness (tests pass reliably)
- [ ] Documentation allows new contributors to add tests easily
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline catches regressions before merge

## 🔗 Related Issues
