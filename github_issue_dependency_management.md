# Standardize Dependency Management and Environment Setup

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The Conference Research application currently uses a basic `requirements.txt` approach for dependency management, which creates several issues:

1. **No dependency resolution** - Can lead to version conflicts and broken installations
2. **No development vs production dependencies** - Development tools mixed with runtime requirements
3. **Missing dependency locking** - No guarantee that installations are reproducible
4. **No environment standardization** - Developers may use different Python versions and setups
5. **Complex manual setup** - New contributors struggle with environment configuration

This creates barriers to onboarding new developers and can lead to "works on my machine" problems that make debugging and deployment unreliable.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

### Modern Dependency Management
- [ ] **Replace `requirements.txt` with `pyproject.toml`** using modern Python packaging standards
- [ ] **Separate dependency groups**: production, development, testing, documentation
- [ ] **Add dependency locking** with `poetry.lock` or `pip-tools` generated lockfiles
- [ ] **Specify Python version requirements** clearly (currently 3.9+)
- [ ] **Pin critical dependencies** while allowing compatible updates for non-critical packages

### Development Environment Standardization
- [ ] **Create `Dockerfile`** for consistent development environments
- [ ] **Add `docker-compose.yml`** for easy local development with all services
- [ ] **Create `.devcontainer`** configuration for VS Code Development Containers
- [ ] **Add environment validation script** to check for required tools and versions
- [ ] **Document environment setup** with multiple installation methods

### Installation and Setup Automation
- [ ] **Create `Makefile`** or `scripts/` folder with common development tasks:
  - `make install` - Install dependencies and set up environment
  - `make test` - Run full test suite
  - `make lint` - Run code quality checks
  - `make dev` - Start development server
  - `make clean` - Clean up temporary files and caches
- [ ] **Add setup validation** to verify installation success
- [ ] **Create development quickstart** documentation

### Dependency Security and Updates
- [ ] **Add `safety` checks** for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] **Integrate `dependabot`** or similar for automated dependency updates
- [ ] **Document security update process** for critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Add dependency scanning** to CI/CD pipeline

- **`.gitignore`** - Add new artifacts (poetry cache, docker volumes, etc.)
- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`** - Update to use new dependency management
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Update with new development setup process

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Dependency Management Strategy:
```toml
# pyproject.toml example structure
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel"]

[project]
name = "conference-research"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Automated conference and campus research workflows"
requires-python = ">=3.9"

EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "BioGen.py"]
```

### Environment Validation Script:
```python
# scripts/validate_env.py
def validate_environment():
    """Validate development environment setup"""
    checks = [
        check_python_version(),
        check_dependencies(),
        check_api_keys(),
        check_browser_drivers(),
    ]
    return all(checks)
```

## 🔗 Dependencies and Blocking Issues

### Prerequisites:
- **Testing Infrastructure** - Automated tests needed to validate environment setup
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing of installation process

### Enables:
- **Containerized Deployment** - Standardized production environments
- **Better Documentation** - Consistent setup instructions
- **Contributor Onboarding** - Faster new developer productivity

## 💡 Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate - Week 1):
1. Create `pyproject.toml` with proper dependency groups
2. Generate lockfiles for reproducible installations
3. Create basic `Makefile` with common tasks
4. Update `README.md` with new installation instructions

### Phase 2 (Short-term - Week 2):
1. Add Docker development environment
2. Create environment validation scripts
3. Set up automated dependency scanning
4. Add VS Code dev container configuration

### Phase 3 (Medium-term - Week 3):
1. Full documentation updates
2. GitHub Actions integration
3. Dependabot configuration
4. Troubleshooting guides and FAQ

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Backwards Compatibility:
- Keep `requirements.txt` generated from `pyproject.toml` for existing users
- Provide migration guide for existing installations
- Test new setup process thoroughly before deprecating old method

### Security Considerations:
- Use official base images for Docker setup
- Pin security-critical dependencies
- Regular security scanning and updates
- Document security update procedures

## 📖 Additional Context

This standardization effort will significantly improve the developer experience and reduce onboarding friction. The current `requirements.txt` approach has caused setup issues for contributors and makes it difficult to maintain a consistent development environment across the team.

The investment in proper dependency management will pay dividends in reduced support burden, faster development cycles, and more reliable deployments.
