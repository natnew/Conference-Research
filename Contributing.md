# Contributing to the Conference Delegate Information Retrieval and Email Template Generation Project

We are excited to have contributors from the community help enhance and expand this project. Your contributions are invaluable, helping to improve the system for retrieving and processing conference delegate information and generating personalised email templates. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, we welcome contributions of all kinds!

## How Can You Contribute?

We welcome contributions from developers and users of all levels. Here are some ways you can contribute to this project:

### Code Contributions

- **Feature Requests**: Suggest and implement new features to enhance the system’s capabilities. This could include improving web scraping, enhancing GPT-based data completion, or refining the mail merge process.
- **Bug Fixes**: Identify and resolve bugs to improve the stability and performance of the project. Bugs could be related to data scraping, integration with the GPT API, or the mail merge process.
- **Performance Improvements**: Help optimise the codebase for better speed and efficiency. For example, you could work on optimising web scraping performance, streamlining data processing, or reducing the time required to generate email templates.
- **Documentation**: Improve or expand the project documentation. This includes writing clear instructions for new users, documenting features, and providing examples to help others understand the project.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to ensure that individual components (such as web scraping or API integration) work as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Develop integration tests to ensure that different parts of the system (e.g., web scraping, data completion, mail merge) work together without issues.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to identify usability issues within the **Streamlit app** or the **chatbot interface**. Your feedback can help improve the user experience for editors and other end-users.

### Support & Community

- **Issue Resolution**: Engage with the community on the GitHub Issues page to troubleshoot and resolve reported issues. Whether it’s a bug in web scraping or GPT API integration, your help is appreciated.
- **Discussion**: Participate in discussions to shape the future development of the project. We value your input on new feature ideas, performance improvements, and best practices for interacting with the GPT API and web scraping tools.
- **Workshops & Tutorials**: Create tutorials, workshops, or video content to help new users understand how to set up and use the system, contribute to the codebase, or optimise the pipeline.
