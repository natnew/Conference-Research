1. What is the purpose of this project?
>The project automates the retrieval of conference delegate information and the generation of personalised email templates. By integrating web scraping, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial intelligence (AI), the system streamlines conference preparation tasks, reducing manual effort for editors and organisers.

2. How does the system gather delegate information?
>The system uses web scraping tools such as Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium to collect delegate names, email addresses, universities, and bios from conference websites. It also uses the GPT API to complete missing information (such as bios or emails) by filling in the gaps where required.

3. What is the role of the GPT API in this project?
>The GPT API is used to generate missing or incomplete data for delegate profiles, such as generating bios or filling in missing emails. It uses prompt engineering techniques to generate content that is accurate and relevant to the context of the conferences.

4. How does the mail merge process work in this project?
>After the system retrieves and processes the delegate information, the data is stored in an Excel file. The mail merge feature in Microsoft Word or Outlook is used to automatically populate email templates with the delegate’s information (e.g., name, bio, email). This allows for efficient, personalised email generation for outreach purposes.

5. How are inconsistencies in the scraped data handled?
>The system includes a data preprocessing module that cleans and formats the raw data from different conferences. For incomplete or inconsistent data, the system uses the GPT API to fill in gaps, but manual intervention may occasionally be required if the data is too complex or incomplete.

6. What evaluation methods are used to assess the system’s accuracy?
>The system's performance is evaluated using:

>Metrics-based evaluation: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
LLM-based evaluation: Uses language models to evaluate the quality of generated outputs.
Human-based evaluation: Editors or the development team manually review a subset of outputs for content accuracy and fluency.

7. What are the limitations of the system?
>Some of the key limitations include:

>Difficulty in scraping dynamically loaded websites or those requiring JavaScript and CAPTCHAs.
The limited context length of the GPT model, which can restrict the system’s ability to process large amounts of historical or detailed data.
Occasional manual intervention is needed to validate and correct data that the system cannot fully retrieve or complete automatically.
8. How does the system handle long delegate profiles or complex information?
>The system processes delegate profiles using the GPT API, but the finite context length of the model can limit the amount of detailed information it can handle at one time. For lengthy or complex profiles, the system may require additional passes or manual validation to ensure all details are accurately included.

9. How does the chatbot assist users?
>The chatbot, integrated into the Streamlit app, allows users to query delegate information in real-time and provides suggestions for follow-up emails or other conference-related communication. It’s a conversational tool designed to make it easier to interact with the dataset during conferences.

10. How can the system be improved?
>Future improvements could include:

>Expanding the context window of the GPT model to handle more complex and detailed data.
Enhancing the data validation layer to automate more complex checks and reduce the need for manual intervention.
Improving the scraping process to handle JavaScript-heavy websites or websites with dynamic content.

11. What are the security implications of using this system?
>The system scrapes publicly available delegate information and uses secure methods to handle and process the data. However, additional security measures such as encryption can be implemented based on the organisation’s needs, especially when handling sensitive delegate data.

12. Can this system handle large volumes of data?
>Yes, the system is designed to be scalable. The hybrid approach of web scraping and API integration allows it to efficiently process large datasets. The mail merge process also scales well, enabling the generation of hundreds or thousands of personalised emails quickly.

13. How does the system deal with errors in data generation or completion?
>If the system encounters errors or inconsistencies, it first attempts to fill in missing information using the GPT API. However, if the API is unable to generate relevant content, manual intervention is required. Additionally, a validation layer checks for errors in the completed data by cross-referencing reliable external sources.

14. What tools and libraries are used in the project?
>The project relies on several key tools and libraries, including:

>Python: For web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium), data processing (Pandas), and API integration.
GPT API: For generating and completing missing delegate data.
Streamlit: To provide an interactive interface for editors and organisers to access, filter, and manage the delegate data.
Microsoft Word/Outlook: For automating the email generation process through mail merge.
