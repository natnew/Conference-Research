## ✅ Summary of Changes

### 1. 🧪 Complete Testing Infrastructure Implementation
- **Files:** `tests/` directory (conftest.py, test_file_validation.py, test_retry_logic.py, test_scrapping_module.py, test_web_scraping.py)
- **Change:** Implemented comprehensive pytest testing framework with 70%+ coverage requirement, including unit tests for file validation, API retry logic, web scraping, and integration testing
- **Impact:** Establishes enterprise-grade testing foundation ensuring code quality, security validation, and preventing regressions through automated testing

### 2. 🏗️ Modern Dependency Management & Containerization
- **Files:** `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `scripts/make.py`, `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- **Change:** Replaced requirements.txt with modern pyproject.toml configuration, added Docker containerization, cross-platform development scripts, and CI/CD pipeline across multiple OS and Python versions
- **Impact:** Modernizes development workflow, enables consistent environments, automates testing across platforms (Ubuntu/Windows/macOS), and streamlines deployment with Docker containers

### 3. ⚙️ Centralized Configuration Management System
- **Files:** `con_research/config/config_manager.py`, `config/*.yaml`, `BioGen.py` (updated)
- **Change:** Implemented Pydantic-based configuration system with environment-aware settings (development/testing/production), YAML-based configs, and eliminated hardcoded values throughout application
- **Impact:** Enhances security through environment-specific configurations, improves maintainability, enables flexible deployment across environments, and centralizes all application settings

### 4. 🔒 Enhanced Security & File Processing
- **Files:** File validation modules, security scanning implementations
- **Change:** Added comprehensive file upload validation, security scanning for malicious content, MIME type verification, and input sanitization across all user inputs
- **Impact:** Protects against malicious file uploads, ensures data integrity, implements enterprise-grade security protocols, and provides safe file processing workflows

### 5. 📚 Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul
- **Files:** `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`, `README.md`, `reports/User_Guide.md`
- **Change:** Created detailed testing guides, development environment documentation, enhanced usage examples, updated project README, and restructured user guide with improved organization
- **Impact:** Improves developer onboarding, standardizes development processes, provides clear implementation examples, and enhances user experience with better documentation structure

### 6. 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline & GitHub Integration
- **Files:** `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/copilot-setup-steps.yaml`
- **Change:** Implemented GitHub Actions for automated testing, added GitHub Copilot integration, and created automated setup configurations for AI-assisted development
- **Impact:** Ensures continuous integration quality checks, prevents code regressions, automates testing on every commit, and enhances developer productivity with AI assistance
